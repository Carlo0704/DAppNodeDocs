# DAppNodeSDK

The DappnodeSDK `dappnodesdk` is a tool that makes creating and publishing new Dappnode packages as simple as possible. It helps to initialize, build, test, and publish the new package/repo to an APM tracked on the Ethereum Mainnet.

We have deployed a public APM (Aragon Package Manager) registry in which anyone can create their own APM repository: [public.dappnode.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/public.dappnode.eth)
