As a Dappnode Node Runner, you can easily earn rewards by validating blocks for some Proof of Stake chains (Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, LUKSO, Avalanche). You will need to "stake" some crypto as a safety deposit in order to start 1) validating blocks, 2) securing the chain, and 3) earning more crypto, and that's why this activity is also known as "Staking". 

We make staking extremely simple! Pick your chain, follow the instructions in this documentation, and happy staking!
