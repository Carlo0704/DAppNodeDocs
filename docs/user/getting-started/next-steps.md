# Next Steps

Now that your DAppNode is set up and ready to go, it's time to explore further configurations and features to get the most out of your experience. Here are some of the most common next steps:

[**🔐 Configure VPN access**](/docs/user/access-your-dappnode/vpn): Using either Wireguard or OpenVPN, you will be able to connect  to your Dappnode from inside or outside your local network.

[**💰 Start Staking and Earning Rewards**](/docs/user/staking/overview.md): This is a backup connection method. It allows you to connect to Dappmanager when you're on the same local network. It's mainly for recovery purposes because of its limitations.

[**🔔 Configure Ethical Metrics**](docs/user/ethical-metrics/overview.md): Ethical metrics is a privacy-focused monitoring tool for Dappnode. You will be able to receive alerts related to your Dappnode's performance and health.
