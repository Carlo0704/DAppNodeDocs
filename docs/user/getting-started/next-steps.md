# Next Steps

Now that your DAppNode is set up and ready to go, it's time to explore further configurations and features to get the most out of your experience. Here are some of the most common next steps:

[**🔐 Configure VPN access**](/docs/user/access-your-dappnode/vpn/overview): Using either Wireguard or OpenVPN, you will be able to connect to your Dappnode from wherever you are in the world. You will be able to access your dappnode outside of the range of the wifi, while on holidays or during your commute!

[**💰 Start Staking and Earning Rewards**](/docs/user/staking/overview.md): You can start validating Proof-of-Stake networks like Ethereum, Gnosis Chain or LUKSO and earn rewards for securing the network.

[**🔔 Configure Ethical Metrics**](docs/user/ethical-metrics/overview.md): Ethical metrics is a privacy-focused monitoring tool for Dappnode. You will be able to receive alerts related to your Dappnode's performance and health.
