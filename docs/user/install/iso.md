# Install - ISO

When you want to perform a clean installation by installing the base operating system and Dappnode. Installing from an ISO will wipe the machine data and install Debian + Dappnode.

## Get the ISO

You can get the image downloading directly from [DappnodeISO](https://github.com/dappnode/Dappnode/releases) or if you prefer you can build it from the [source](https://github.com/dappnode/Dappnode#install-dappnode-with-iso).

## Burn the ISO in a USB

Burn the ISO to an USB stick. To do so we recommend using [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) for the OS with which you will prepare the USB to boot from your server and install Dappnode.

IF YOU EXECUTE THE BOOTABLE USB IN A MACHINE CONTAINING DATA, ALL EXISTING DATA WILL BE ERASED.

Also, Dappnode is intended to run 24/7 so if you install it on a laptop or desktop machine and you turn it off, it will not stay synced.
